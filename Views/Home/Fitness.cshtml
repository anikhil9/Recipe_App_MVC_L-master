                <p>Cardiovascular exercise, also known as cardio or aerobic exercise, is essential for maintaining a healthy heart and lungs. Activities like running, swimming, and cycling increase the heart rate, improve blood circulation, and can reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Incorporating at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week can offer significant health benefits.</p>
